Working with Laravel Easy Search

- add search on model 

- Global search
  - This allow you to search all the columns in the table.
  - Laravel easy search will search the table only with the filters generated on production but will through an error on local/development.
  - If you want to ignore some columns you can second arguments to ignore the columns.
  ``` php
  ->allowedColumns(['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at'])
  ```
  - by default global search users `search` as the query filter you can replace that by adding the first parameter
  ``` php
  ->searchAllColumns('filter')
  ```
  Make sure you check the 

Add Searchable trait to your model

You can now use Laravel searchable as

``` php
//First make sure you extend Search facade on your controller

use AppsLab\LaravelEasySearch\Facades\Search;

class NameController extends Controller
{
    public index(){
    $results = Search::model(Model::class)
    //Allowed Collumns methods guide you to search only columns added by default if you don't add allowedColumn all solumns will be return
                ->allowedColumns(['name'])
                //Applying filter from your request
                ->applyFilter() //This will search using the filters you generated if filter is not available it will throw a class does not exist error. You can change the filter from the request by adding an array with the key as the filter and the value as the request key
                ->applyFilter(['search_name' => 'name']) This will replace the search_name with name. Name is the filter name
                //Sort by allow you to sort the result pass an array
                ->sortBy('column','ASC')
                //Do you want to add a query? yeah you can do that by building your query connect to the model
                ->buildQuery('whereHas', ['warehouse', function(Builder $query){
                        $query->where('name' , 'like', '%neo%');
                    }])
                //You can add relation addRelation as string or array
                ->addRelation('users')
                // use first to get first item on search
                ->first()

    }
}
```
``` php
use Searchable; 
```

``` php
$skeleton = new Spatie\Skeleton();
